                  <p class="parrafo_blanco text-justify">2015 was a very complicated year in which we faced multiple adversities. However, we are proud of the solid results we are reporting. These numbers speak to Pochteca’s strengths that allowed us to successfully overcome the challenges we were confronted by including the deflationary and recessionary environment being experienced by industries that are key to the products we distribute and the double digit reductions registered in oil prices (-30% in 2015), and many raw materials (some which fell as much as 50%), a development that has now affected us for two consecutive years.</p>

            <h5 class="verde_fuerte" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Factors that supported the solid growth achieved in 2015:</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="row text-justify">
            <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
              <br><br><br><h5>High degree of client and product diversification</h5>
                <p>At Pochteca we regard risk diversification as a top
priority. We attend to more than 19,000 customers in
more than 40 industrial sectors, offering them more
than 5,500 products. Our goal is to maintain low levels
of dependence on both clients and products.</p>
                <p>No client accounted for more than 2% of sales in
2015 (our five biggest clients jointly represented less
than 6%), and no product accounted for more than
2.0% of revenues (less than 7% of sales consisted of
our five most popular products).</p>
                <p>We believe that this high degree of diversification
has proven to be highly beneficial for the company
over the years, and even more so in periods of high
volatility and when multiple sectors of the economy
experience a deceleration of activity.</p>
                <h5>One-stop-shop proposal and diversification into mixes</h5>
                <p>We offer a broad portfolio in a single channel,
developing products tailored to meet our clients’
needs, and with professional technical support at both
the pre- and post-sales level. We are convinced that
this one-stop-shop approach greatly aided our 2015
results, mitigating the negative effects of sharp price
decreases and allowing us to grow our gross margins.</p>
                <p>Another factor that has helped us to boost profitability
in an adverse environment is our increasing
diversification into higher-margin and less-volatile
products such as blends and sales of packaged
products. Both product categories have played an
important role in improving our profitability despite the
complex environment we were faced with.</p>
                <h5>Financial Position</h5>
                <p>At the end of 2015, net debt totaled Ps 554 million,
9% or Ps 57 million less than at the end of 2014. It
is important to note that we concluded our refinancing
of a Ps 610 million, syndicated credit on December
4, 2014. The original credit had been scheduled to
mature in June 2015 while the new loan is for four
years with a one-year grace period.</p>
                <p>We enjoy a strong financial position as reflected in our
debt metrics. The solid results we achieved in the year
allowed us to lower our net debt to EBITDA to 1.6
times from 2.0 times at the end of 2014, a level in line
with our policy of keeping it to a maximum of 2 times.
We should also note that net debt to EBITDA rose
to a record high of 2.8 times in 1Q13, following the
acquisition of Coremal.</p>
                <h5>2016 Outlook <span class="pleca_gris"> G4-EC2</span></h5>
                <p>We do not expect the environment to improve
substantially during 2016. More specifically, we do not
anticipate a sudden reactivation of economic activity
or of the oil industry. However, we do expect continuing
growth in demand for the products we distribute.
Moreover, we expect the prices of most of our products
to remain depressed. Nevertheless, we are confident
that our one-stop-shop proposal will continue to help
us penetrate new businesses and expand market share.</p>
                <p>However, consumption in other sectors such as lubricants,
food and chemicals will continue to stoke demand for
the products we distribute. We believe that product prices
have finally bottomed and will continue to gradually
recover. Our one-stop-shop proposal will continue to
serve as an important mitigating factor. We believe
that this strategy will assist us in our quest to continue
penetrating businesses and expanding market share.</p>
                <p>We continue to view export manufacturing and
Mexico’s energy reform as growth drivers in Mexico.
Our exposure to the export manufacturing industry
is a source of strength. We expect Mexico’s energy
reform to further bolster manufacturing albeit in a
less pronounced way than what was anticipated when
the reform was first adopted in 2013. We reiterate
our confidence that the competitive gap relative to
China will continue to shift in Mexico’s favor, thereby
encouraging more foreign firms to move operations
to Mexico in order to better supply the US market.</p>
                <p>Our operations in Brazil face major hurdles due to
the complex environment the country is experiencing.
However, we believe that Pochteca enjoys major
growth opportunities in that market.</p>
                <p>We will continue to harmonize our processes in
both countries while expanding the sale of Pochteca
products that were not in Coremal’s pre acquisition
portfolio such as chemicals for the food industry,
for oil exploration and drilling and lubricants.</p>

              <h5>Sustainability</h5>
                <p>At Pochteca we are making efficient use of natural,
economic and social resources in ways that conform
with our commitment to sustainability.</p>
                <p>Our Integrated Management System (IMS) is the basis
for assuring the successful realization of our financial
objectives and growth targets while complying with
the national and international standards that we have
voluntarily adopted. Similarly, our secure and worldclass
chain of custody adds value to the producers
of raw materials (our suppliers) and of chemical
products (our clients).</p>
                <p>We will also continue to endeavor to establish
performance indicators that allow us to measure and
control product safety, occupational health, quality
and safety risks and environmental impact risks.</p>
                <p>Pochteca is well prepared to continue handling
challenges such as those we encountered in 2015
and we will do so in 2016. We have capable
personnel, solid cash generation and a strong financial
position. Those are the factors that underpin our
optimism regarding the business’ future prospects.</p>
                <p>We wish to recognize and thank our shareholders,
colleagues, clients, suppliers, and financial institutions
for the support they gave us during 2015.</p>
